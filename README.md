Works with Arduino IDEs version 1.6.x and later (tested with 1.6.4)

Open the menu "File" > "Preferences" and add the following text to the box "Additional Boards Manager URLs":

**NOTE**
The link points to the package description file in the "master" branch, that may include new releases in the future.
Maintainers and contributors, please use a separate branch for new releases, so that the above link does not break inadvertently and a clean merge can be prepared for inclusion in the "master" branch.
